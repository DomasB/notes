## Get out
**Travel Timeline Consideration:**

1. **Floating Hotel to Mainland:** Depending on the location of floating hotel, boat ride could take from 30 minutes to over an hour.
2. **Transfer to Surat Thani Airport:** The drive to Surat Thani Airport can take 1.5 to 2 hours.
3. **Airport Check-in:** Be at the airport at least 1-1.5 hours before your flight, considering check-in, security, and potential queues.

Adding up these times start your journey by around 7:30 AM or earlier.

**Suggestions:**

1. **Early Checkout:** Coordinate with the hotel staff to arrange an early morning boat transfer back to the mainland. They're used to such requests given the remote nature of the accommodations.
2. **Pre-arranged Transportation:** Given the early hour and the importance of catching your flight, consider pre-booking a reliable taxi or transfer service to Surat Thani Airport.
3. **Bag Prep:** Pack your bags the night before, so you're ready to move quickly in the morning.
