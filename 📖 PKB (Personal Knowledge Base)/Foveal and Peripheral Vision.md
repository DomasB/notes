When scanning text, the eyes use foveal vision (center vision) for focused reading and peripheral vision for skimming and identifying important sections. This technique allows for rapid content assessment.

Leveraging foveal and peripheral vision allows for simultaneous skimming and focused reading, maximizing the amount of information processed during scanning.
