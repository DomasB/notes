This strategy involves asking yourself three questions before reading: 
- "What are three things I think I know about this topic?" 
After reading, ask:
- "What are two things I learned that I didn't know before?"
Finally, ask:
- "What is one thing I still have a question about?"

This approach encourages critical thinking and engagement with the material.
