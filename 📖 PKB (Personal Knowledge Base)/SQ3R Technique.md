SQ3R stands for Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review. This approach is commonly used for effective reading and information scanning. It involves **surveying** the content to get an overview, **generating questions** to focus the reading, **reading** the material carefully, **reciting** key points to reinforce memory, and **reviewing** the content to consolidate understanding.

The SQ3R technique is highly effective for in-depth reading and understanding of complex materials. It encourages active engagement with the content through question generation and summarization.
