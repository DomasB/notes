### Introduction to AGI and its Importance

This section introduces the concept of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and underscores its significance in the current AI landscape. AGI is portrayed as an AI system matching or surpassing human capabilities across a broad spectrum of tasks. The rapidly advancing field of Machine Learning (ML) has elevated AGI from a theoretical concept to one of near-term practical relevance. The authors note a variety of perspectives within the AI community about the current state and future potential of AGI, highlighting the diversity of opinions and the challenges in defining AGI consistently.

The section also points out the crucial roles AGI plays in terms of goals, predictions, and risks associated with AI:

1. **Goals**: AGI is seen as a north-star objective for AI research, tying back to the origins of AI in the 1950s and echoed in the missions of contemporary AI organizations.
2. **Predictions**: AGI is associated with the advancement toward more general AI capabilities, potentially leading to emergent properties and societal impacts, including economic and geopolitical consequences.
3. **Risks**: The concept of AGI is intertwined with the identification of extreme risks, speculating that AGI systems might possess capabilities such as deception, resource accumulation, and recursive self-improvement.

The authors argue for the necessity of a shared, operationalizable definition of AGI to facilitate clear comparisons between models, enable effective risk assessments, and provide a framework for policy and regulation.

I will now proceed to summarize the next section of the article, focusing on the existing definitions of AGI.

### Defining AGI: Reviewing Existing Definitions

In this section, the authors analyze nine prominent AGI definitions, highlighting their strengths and limitations. This analysis is fundamental in shaping the paper's proposed AGI framework:

1. **Turing Test**: Initially proposed by Alan Turing, this test assesses AI's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human. However, modern large language models (LLMs) passing some forms of the Turing Test indicate that it may be insufficient for benchmarking AGI. The authors propose that AGI should be defined by capabilities rather than processes.
    
2. **Strong AI – Consciousness in Systems**: This concept, explored by John Searle, suggests that a true AGI would possess consciousness. However, the lack of scientific consensus on measuring consciousness in machines makes this definition impractical.
    
3. **Human Brain Analogies**: The earliest usage of "artificial general intelligence" in 1997 emphasized processes similar to the human brain and capabilities in a wide range of knowledge areas. The authors argue that strict brain-based benchmarks are not necessary for AGI, as evidenced by the success of non-human-like learning architectures.
    
4. **Human-Level Performance on Cognitive Tasks**: This approach defines AGI as a machine capable of performing cognitive tasks at human levels, focusing on non-physical tasks. The ambiguity around the selection of tasks and benchmark individuals is noted.
    
5. **Ability to Learn a Range of Tasks**: This definition highlights AGI's ability to learn and perform a broad range of tasks, similar to human capabilities. It emphasizes the importance of metacognitive tasks in AGI.
    
6. **Economic Value of Work**: OpenAI's definition characterizes AGI as systems that surpass human performance in most economically valuable work. While focusing on performance, this definition may not capture all intelligence criteria, such as emotional intelligence or artistic creativity.
    
7. **Flexibility and General Intelligence – "Coffee Test"**: This conceptualization views AGI as an intelligence that is flexible, general, and resourceful, on par with or beyond human intelligence. It includes operational benchmarks, like Marcus' five tasks, but the authors note that passing these tasks may not be sufficient for AGI status.
    
8. **Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI)**: Proposed by Suleyman, ACI refers to AI systems capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks in the real world, emphasizing economic value and real-world applications.
    
9. **State-of-the-Art LLMs as Generalists**: Some researchers assert that current LLMs, like GPT-4, have achieved AGI due to their generality across a range of tasks. However, the authors argue that generality must be paired with reliable performance.
    

Next, I will summarize the principles the authors believe should guide a clear and operationalizable definition of AGI.

### Principles for a Clear AGI Definition

This section presents six principles the authors believe are essential for formulating a useful and operationalizable definition of AGI. These principles were distilled from the analysis of existing AGI definitions:

1. **Focus on Capabilities, Not Processes**: The definition of AGI should concentrate on what an AI system can achieve rather than how it achieves these outcomes. This approach avoids the need for AGI systems to emulate human-like thinking or consciousness, which are challenging to measure.
    
2. **Emphasis on Generality and Performance**: A comprehensive definition of AGI should include both generality across a range of tasks and high performance in these tasks. This dual focus is key to characterizing AGI's capabilities.
    
3. **Inclusion of Cognitive and Metacognitive Tasks**: The definition should prioritize cognitive tasks (non-physical tasks) while recognizing the importance of metacognitive abilities like learning new tasks or knowing when to seek help. Physical tasks, while increasing a system's generality, should not be a prerequisite for AGI.
    
4. **Focus on Potential, Not Deployment**: The definition should be based on the capability to perform tasks, not on actual deployment in real-world settings. This distinction avoids conflating technical ability with external factors like legal or ethical considerations.
    
5. **Requirement for Ecological Validity**: Tasks used to benchmark AGI should be ecologically valid, aligning with real-world tasks that people value. This principle advocates for moving beyond traditional AI metrics that may not reflect the skills valued in an AGI.
    
6. **Consideration of the Path to AGI, Not Just the Endpoint**: The journey towards AGI should be conceptualized in stages, similar to the levels of driving automation. This approach facilitates clearer discussions about AI policy, progress, and risk management.

### Levels of AGI Framework

The authors propose a leveled framework for AGI, structured as a matrix combining performance and generality. This framework categorizes AI systems into various levels based on their capabilities:

1. **Matrix Structure**: The matrix has two dimensions:
    
    - **Performance**: This refers to how an AI system's capabilities compare to human performance in specific tasks. Different levels indicate varying degrees of proficiency, ranging from basic (Emerging) to surpassing the best humans (Superhuman).
    - **Generality**: This dimension assesses the breadth of tasks an AI system can perform. It differentiates between systems specialized in narrow tasks and those capable of a wide range of tasks (General AI).
2. **Levels of AGI**:
    
    - **Level 0 (No AI)**: Systems that don't employ AI, like basic calculators or human-in-the-loop systems.
    - **Level 1 (Emerging)**: Systems that match or slightly exceed an unskilled human in performance. Examples include basic rule-based systems and modern large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT.
    - **Level 2 (Competent)**: Systems performing at or above the median skill level of adults in certain tasks. This level has not yet been achieved in AGI.
    - **Level 3 (Expert)**: Systems performing in the top 10% of skilled adults. Examples include advanced grammar checkers and generative image models.
    - **Level 4 (Virtuoso)**: Systems with capabilities in the top 1% of skilled adults. Notable examples are Deep Blue and AlphaGo.
    - **Level 5 (Superhuman/ASI)**: Systems that outperform all humans. Examples include AlphaFold and AlphaZero. This level signifies the transition to Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).
3. **Practical Examples and Implications**: The authors use contemporary AI systems to exemplify how current technologies fit within this framework. They note that systems like DALL-E 2, while theoretically at an "Expert" level in image creation, may perform at a "Competent" level in practice due to user interface limitations.
    

Next, I will summarize the section on testing AGI, which discusses the development of benchmarks to assess AI systems against this framework.

### Testing for AGI

The section on testing for AGI highlights the importance of developing comprehensive benchmarks to accurately assess AI systems according to the proposed levels. Key aspects of this process include:

1. **Benchmarking Criteria**: The benchmarks should include a wide range of cognitive and metacognitive tasks to measure diverse capabilities such as linguistic intelligence, logical reasoning, and social skills. The benchmarks should reflect real-world tasks people value, transcending traditional AI metrics.
    
2. **Living Benchmark Concept**: Recognizing the dynamic nature of AI capabilities, the authors propose a 'living benchmark' that evolves over time, incorporating new tasks and adjusting to the growing abilities of AI systems. This approach ensures that benchmarks remain relevant and challenging.
    
3. **Assessing Generality and Performance**: The benchmarks should evaluate both the breadth (generality) and depth (performance) of AI capabilities. Determining the proportion of tasks a system must master to achieve a certain level of generality is a key challenge.
    
4. **Task Selection and Evolution**: The process of selecting and updating tasks in the benchmark is critical. It involves considering ecological validity and the potential inclusion of tasks that test potentially dangerous capabilities, like persuasion or deception.
    
5. **Iterative Development and Inclusion**: Developing an AGI benchmark is an iterative process requiring contributions from a diverse range of experts across multiple fields. The goal is to create a comprehensive and unbiased tool for measuring progress towards AGI.
    

Next, I will summarize the section on risk assessment in the context of AGI, which discusses the various risks associated with different levels of AGI and their implications.

### Risk Assessment in the Context of AGI

The authors address the topic of risk assessment, examining how different levels of AGI may pose various types of risks and challenges:

1. **Risk Profiles at Different AGI Levels**: As AI systems advance through the AGI levels, they introduce new risks, including misuse, alignment challenges, and structural risks. For instance, "Expert AGI" might bring economic disruption due to labor substitution, while higher levels like "Virtuoso AGI" and "ASI" (Artificial Superintelligence) could present existential risks, such as the potential for AGIs to outperform and deceive humans.
    
2. **Systemic Risks**: The authors highlight concerns about systemic risks, such as international destabilization, which could arise if the progression to higher AGI levels outpaces regulatory or diplomatic efforts.
    
3. **Risk Analysis for Lower Levels of AGI**: For levels below "Expert AGI," such as "Emerging" and "Competent" AGIs, risks are more likely to stem from human actions, including accidental or malicious misuse of AI technologies.
    
4. **Comprehensive Risk Analysis**: A complete analysis of risk profiles associated with each AGI level is crucial for developing effective safety, ethics guidelines, and policymaking.
    
5. **Consideration of Dangerous Capabilities**: The inclusion of potentially harmful capabilities in AGI benchmarking, such as deception or advanced biochemistry, is debated. The authors lean towards including these capabilities for comprehensive assessment, emphasizing the need for safe and controlled benchmarking environments.
    

Next, I'll summarize the section discussing Human-AI Interaction and Autonomy Levels, which explores how AGI capabilities interact with different modes of human-AI collaboration and the resulting risks.

### Human-AI Interaction and Autonomy Levels

This section delves into the interplay between AGI's capabilities and the paradigms of human-AI interaction, introducing a concept of "Levels of Autonomy" in AI systems:

1. **Levels of Autonomy Framework**: The authors propose six levels of autonomy to characterize different modes of human-AI interaction, ranging from no AI involvement (Level 0) to full AI agency (Level 5). Each level reflects the extent of AI's role and decision-making capacity in tasks.
    
2. **Correlation with AGI Levels**: The autonomy levels are aligned with the AGI capability levels. Higher AGI levels enable more advanced autonomy modes, but the choice of autonomy level for a given task depends on various factors, including safety considerations.
    
3. **Examples and Implications of Each Autonomy Level**:
    
    - **Level 0 (No AI)**: Tasks performed entirely by humans, such as traditional manual methods.
    - **Level 1 (AI as a Tool)**: AI assists humans by automating simple sub-tasks.
    - **Level 2 (AI as a Consultant)**: AI plays a substantive role but is invoked and guided by humans.
    - **Level 3 (AI as a Collaborator)**: AI works alongside humans in a co-equal, interactive manner.
    - **Level 4 (AI as an Expert)**: AI leads the interaction, with humans providing guidance or feedback.
    - **Level 5 (AI as an Agent)**: AI operates fully autonomously, making decisions and acting independently.
4. **Risk Profiles Associated with Autonomy Levels**: Each level of autonomy introduces specific risks, such as over-reliance, misuse, or ethical challenges. The framework aids in assessing risks and making informed decisions about deploying AI systems in various contexts.
    
5. **Role of Human-AI Interaction Design**: The design of human-AI interaction paradigms is crucial for safe and responsible deployment of AGI systems. This involves ensuring that AI capabilities are complemented by effective and ethical interaction models.
    

Finally, I will summarize the conclusion of the article, which synthesizes the main ideas and discusses the broader implications of the proposed AGI framework.
