If you're interested in learning prompt engineering, there are several resources available online that can help you get started. Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and context-specific instructions or queries, known as prompts, to elicit desired responses from language models. By leveraging prompt engineering techniques, we can enhance model performance, achieve better control over generated output, and address limitations associated with open-ended language generation. Here are some steps and resources to help you get started:

## Steps to Learn Prompt Engineering

1. Understand the basics of prompt engineering: Prompt engineering involves crafting precise and context-specific instructions or queries, known as prompts, to elicit desired responses from language models. By leveraging prompt engineering techniques, we can enhance model performance, achieve better control over generated output, and address limitations associated with open-ended language generation.

2. Learn the best practices of prompt engineering: Don't be afraid to experiment. Try different approaches and iterate gradually, correcting the model and taking small steps at a time. Use separators in input (e.g. <>) and ask for a structured output (e.g. JSON). Provide a list of actions to complete the task. Whenever feasible, offer the model a set of actions and let it output its “internal thoughts”. In case of short outputs ask for multiple suggestions.

3. Explore examples of prompts: Examples of prompts include text summarization, information extraction, question answering, text classification, conversation, and code generation.

4. Use prompt engineering tools: Prompt engineering tools include LangChain, PromptAppGPT, Prompt-generator-for-ChatGPT, Dust.tt, OpenPrompt, BetterPrompt, Prompt Engine, and Promptify.

5. Take a course on prompt engineering: There are several online courses available that can help you learn prompt engineering, such as the Learn Prompting course, the Prompt Engineering+ course, and the ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers course.
