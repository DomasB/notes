**What is model governance?**
-----------------------------

Model governance is the process for managing ML models to ensure they are secure, ethical, trustworthy, explainable, and comply with relevant regulations. Model governance requires guidelines for data collection, [model training](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-training), testing, and validation, as well as monitoring and updating the models in production.
