**What is a Data Lakehouse?**
-----------------------------

A Data Lakehouse is a modern data architecture that combines the benefits of both data lakes and data warehouses. A Data Lakehouse consists of a file format, such as Apache Hudi, Delta Lake, or Apache Iceberg, and a set of programs for performing transactional updates and database management operations on the files stored in the Lakehouse file format.

**Why is a Lakehouse important?**
---------------------------------

Lakehouses are often used to store the raw data used to compute features. They provide a centralized platform for storing and processing data that is both flexible and cost-effective. Lakehouses also support both batch and real-time processing, making it easier to work with both historical and streaming data.

**Example use of a Data Lakehouse**
-----------------------------------

Apache Hudi is supported by [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Hopsworks](https://www.hopsworks.ai/the-python-centric-feature-store), and [Onehouse](https://www.onehouse.ai/). Delta Lake is supported by [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/). Apache Iceberg is supported by [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) and [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). Spark is popular as a data parallel processing engine to perform [ETL](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/etl) operations on Data Lakehouses.
