**What is a transformation?**
-----------------------------

A transformation is a function that is applied to some input data and produces processed data as output, such as a [[Feature|feature]] in a [[Feature Pipeline|feature pipeline]]. In feature pipelines, you have [model-independent transformations,](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-independent-transformations) while in [training](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/training-pipeline)/[inference pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/inference-pipeline) you can find [model-dependent transformations](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-dependent-transformations).
