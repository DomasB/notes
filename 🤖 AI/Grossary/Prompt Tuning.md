Prompt tuning (PT) is a parameter-efficient adaptation method for LLMs that adds a small number of tunable embeddings to an otherwise frozen model.Â  Prompts do not have to be written in natural language (e.g., English). In prompt tuning (or prefix-tuning), floating-point-valued vectors are searched directly by gradient descent, to maximize the log-probability of outputs.
