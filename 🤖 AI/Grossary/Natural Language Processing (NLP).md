**What is NLP?**
----------------

**‚Äç**NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. NLP is concerned with how computers understand, interpret, and generate human language, both in written and spoken form. NLP is used in ML Systems and [online inference pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/online-inference-pipeline) as part of the user interface (both input and output). In [feature pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-pipeline), NLP is used for language translation, sentiment analysis, text classification, speech recognition, and information extraction.
