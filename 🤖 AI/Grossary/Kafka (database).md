Kafka is a distributed streaming platform designed to build real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka serves as a high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable system that can handle millions of events per second.

It works by subscribing to topics and storing data records on various partitions across multiple brokers, thereby offering capabilities for both data producers and consumers to interact with the system asynchronously.

Kafka is often used as the backbone for **data lakes**, real-time **analytics**, and **monitoring** systems, providing the infrastructure to support data ingestion, storage, and propagation at scale.

In the context of machine learning and AI, Kafka can serve multiple roles.
- **Data Ingestion Layer**
	- Collects, organizes, and funnels real-time data into machine learning models.
	- Supports tasks such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, and sentiment analysis.
	- Offers real-time functionality to update models as soon as new data is available.
	- Improves the accuracy and timeliness of machine learning models.
- **Medium for Model Predictions**
	- Propagates model predictions or decisions to downstream systems or databases.
	- Effectively closes the loop in a real-time machine learning pipeline.
Enables seamless, real-time data flows between various components in an ML/AI architecture.
