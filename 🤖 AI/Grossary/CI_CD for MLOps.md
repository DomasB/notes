**What is CI/CD for MLOps?**
----------------------------

Continuous Integration (CI): CI is the practice of continuously merging code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository, ensuring that the codebase is always up-to-date and consistent. In the context of [MLOps](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/mlops), CI involves integrating new [[ML]] feature/training/inference pipeline code, updating these ML pipelines. Automated testing of feature/training/inference pipelines and [feature functions](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-function) helps ensure that the integrated changes do not introduce bugs or negatively impact the performance of the ML models.

Continuous Deployment (CD): CD is the practice of automatically deploying the integrated and tested features or models to production [feature stores](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-store) or production [model registries](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-registry). CD can also be integrated with feature/model monitoring to enable the automation of model retraining and updating when new data is available or when the performance of the models degrades.

CI/CD for MLOps helps maintain the reliability, reproducibility, and scalability of ML systems by automating the integration, testing, and deployment processes. This enables organizations to deliver high-quality ML models and features more quickly and efficiently, leading to faster innovation and better decision-making.
