**What is a validation set?**
-----------------------------

**‚Äç**The validation set is a subset of the [training data](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/training-data) used to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model during [hyperparameter tuning](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/hyperparameter-tuning) and model selection. By comparing the performance of different models or hyperparameter configurations on the validation set, you can choose the best option without touching the [test set](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/test-set).
