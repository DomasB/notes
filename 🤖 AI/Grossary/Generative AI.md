**What is generative AI?**
--------------------------

Generative AI generally refers to models and techniques that generate new data samples by learning the underlying data distribution. Examples of generative models include [Variational Autoencoders](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73) (VAEs) and [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-are-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/) (GANs). These models learn to generate new samples by capturing the inherent structure and patterns in the training data. [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) and [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) are examples of generative models.
