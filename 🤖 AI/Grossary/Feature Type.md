**What are feature types in machine learning?**
-----------------------------------------------

**‍**A feature type defines the set of valid [encodings](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/encoding-for-features) (model-dependent transformations) that can be performed on a [feature value.](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-value) The standard feature types are categorical (ordinal or nominal), numerical (interval or ratio), and array types (lists or embeddings).

**Why is it important to understand feature types?**
----------------------------------------------------

**‍**Feature types determine how feature values can be encoded and represented in a machine learning model. Different types of features require different types of encoding and processing, and using the wrong encoding for a feature type can lead to inaccurate or suboptimal [model performance](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-performance).
