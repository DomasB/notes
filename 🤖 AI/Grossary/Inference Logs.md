What are inference logs?
------------------------

Inference logs are the input and output of [inference pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/inference-pipeline). Where possible, inference logs should be stored as rows, where each row includes the unencoded [[Feature Value|feature values]] and the corresponding model prediction. Inference logs are required by both feature and [model monitoring](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-monitoring).
