**What is a feature value?**
----------------------------

A feature value is a measurement (or value) of a feature at a given point in time. For example, if a feature referred to the number of times you logged into a social media site in the previous day, the feature value would be updated once per day and potentially have a different value for each day of the year. There could be up to 365 different feature values for the year.
