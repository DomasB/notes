**What is feature logic?**
--------------------------

**‍**Feature logic is the series of steps that transform input data into the unencoded data value that represents the feature in the feature store. The encoding step, which is model-specific, is not typically considered part of the feature logic. 

‍**How should you implement feature logic?**
--------------------------------------------

In [feature engineering](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-engineering), we describe how your choice of framework depends on your [feature freshness](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-freshness) requirements and data processing volume - with popular frameworks including Pandas, Polars, Spark, Flink, and SQL. There are other specialized frameworks available, such as [Facebook Prophet](https://mlpills.dev/time-series/time-series-forecasting-with-facebook-prophet-i/) for time-series data or [Feature Tools](https://www.featuretools.com/) for automated feature engineering.

Below is an example of feature logic in Python for creating a feature that represents the number of words in a text document:


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def word_count_feature(text_column):
    
    # Split text into words
    words = text_column.str.split()
    
    # Count the number of words in each document
    word_count = words.apply(lambda x: len(x))
        
    return word_count

# Load text data
data = pd.read_csv('text_data.csv')

# Create word count feature
data['word_count'] = word_count_feature(data['text_column'])

```
In this example, the **word\_count\_feature** function takes a column of text data as input, splits the text into words, and returns a count of the number of words in each document. The resulting [feature values](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-value) are then added to the original dataset as a new column. Later, you could write those values as part of a Pandas DataFrame to a feature group.
