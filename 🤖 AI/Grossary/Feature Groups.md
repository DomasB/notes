**What are feature groups in a feature store?**
-----------------------------------------------

A feature group is a logical table of features that provides a single API for updating [feature values](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-value), two different APIs - an online and an offline API - for reading feature values. In practice, feature groups are stored in a dual database system with an online database storing the latest feature values in row-oriented table formatÂ  (e.g., OLTP databases or key-value stores) for fast feature retrieval during online inference, and the second offline database stores the historical feature values in a column-oriented store (e.g., data warehouse/lakehouse or object store). The offline API (to the [offline store](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/offline-store)) is used to create [[Training Data|training data]] and batch inference data. The data between the online and offline stores should be kept consistent by the [feature store](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-store).

A feature group has an *entity\_id* (or primary key), and optionally an *event\_time* column (indicating when the features in that row were observed), and a *partition\_key* (to layout the data in the offline store for faster query performance). Each row in the [online store](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/online-store) is uniquely identified by its *entity\_id* (as the online store only stores the latest values for entities), but the offline store stores historical feature values for entities, so each row is uniquely identified by the (*entity\_id*, *event\_time*) pair. For example, for a credit card, the online store would only store the latest transaction feature data (with the credit card number as the *entity\_id*), but the offline store would store all the historical transactions for that credit card - each transaction is uniquely identified by the credit card number and the timestamp for that transaction.

The other columns in a feature group are the [[Feature|features]]. You can select a particular feature (column) as the partition key for a feature group to determine how to layout the rows in the offline store such that you can efficiently query the data using queries with the *partition\_key*. For example, if your partition key is the day and you have hundreds of days worth of data, with a day *partition\_key*, you can query for a given day or a range of days, and only the data for those days will be read from disk (a push-down filter).
