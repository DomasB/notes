**What is feature encoding?**
-----------------------------

[[Feature|Feature values](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-value) can be encoded for (1) [data compatibility](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/data-compatibility) or (2) to improve [model performance](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-performance). For data compatibility, your modeling algorithm may need, for example, to convert non-numeric [features]] into numerical values or to resize inputs to a fixed size. Many deep-learning models have better performance when their numerical input features are standardized - that is, they have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

**Do I need feature encoding?**
-------------------------------

Probably, but it depends on your modeling algorithm. Examples of modeling algorithms that require encoding categorical features are deep learning and [XGBoost](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/data-science/xgboost/). [Catboost](https://catboost.ai/), however, does not require encoding categorical features. XGBoost works fine without encoding numerical features. However, deep learning models require encoding of numerical features to improve their performance. 

‍**Example of categorical and numerical encoding in Scikit-Learn**
------------------------------------------------------------------


```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# One-hot encode categorical features
cat_features = ['color', 'size']
encoder = OneHotEncoder()
encoded_features = encoder.fit_transform(data[cat_features])

# Scale numerical features
num_features = ['weight', 'height']
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(data[num_features])

# Concatenate encoded and scaled features
X = pd.concat([pd.DataFrame(encoded_features.toarray()), pd.DataFrame(scaled_features, columns=num_features)], axis=1)

```
Here the data contains both categorical and numerical features. The categorical features are one-hot encoded using scikit-learn's [**OneHotEncoder**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder.html), which creates a binary representation of each stringified category. The numerical features are standardized using scikit-learn's [**StandardScaler**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html), which subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation. Finally, the encoded and scaled features are concatenated into a single feature matrix X, which can be used as input to a machine learning model.
