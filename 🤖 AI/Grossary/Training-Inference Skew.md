**What is training-inference skew?**
------------------------------------

[Model-dependent transformations](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-dependent-transformations) are applied in both the [training](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/training-pipeline) and [inference pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/inference-pipeline). Training-inference skew is when there are (even slightly) different implementations of a transformation between the training and inference pipelines. Training-inference skew can silently and negatively affect [model performance](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-performance) and is a hard bug to detect.

**Why is it important to watch for training-inference skew?**
-------------------------------------------------------------

Training-inference skew is a discrepancy that arises when the data preprocessing or feature transformation steps differ between the training and inference pipelines. Such inconsistencies can lead to degraded model performance and hard-to-detect issues in real-world applications. It is crucial to watch for training-inference skew for several reasons:

1. **Model performance**: Discrepancies between training and inference pipelines can result in the model performing poorly when deployed, even if it performed well during training and validation.
2. **Debugging and troubleshooting**: Training-inference skew can be challenging to identify and diagnose, as the issues often stem from subtle differences in the implementation of data preprocessing or feature transformations.
3. **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that the same data preprocessing and feature transformation steps are used in both pipelines is essential for achieving reproducible results.
