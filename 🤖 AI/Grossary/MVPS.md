## What is a MVPS?
A MVPS is a Minimal Viable Prediction Service. It is the simplest end-to-end ML system that includes the three main ML pipelines: a [[Feature Pipeline|feature pipeline]], a [[training pipeline]], and an [[inference pipeline]] and uses a [[feature store]] and [[model registry]] as the shared data layer. A MVPS should show stakeholders how a model will AI-enable some existing or new service in the environment in which the model will be used. A MVPS should also show how the [[model performance]] is related to the business KPIs that the prediction service should improve.
