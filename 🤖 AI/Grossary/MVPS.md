**What is a MVPS?**
-------------------

A MVPS is a Minimal Viable Prediction Service. It is the simplest end-to-end ML system that includes the three main ML pipelines: a [feature pipeline](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-pipeline), a [training pipeline](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/training-pipeline), and an [inference pipeline](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/inference-pipeline) and uses a [feature store](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-store) and [model registry](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-registry) as the shared data layer. A MVPS should show stakeholders how a model will AI-enable some existing or new service in the environment in which the model will be used. A MVPS should also show how the [model performance](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-performance) is related to the business KPIs that the prediction service should improve.
