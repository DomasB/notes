**What are schemas in feature stores?**
---------------------------------------

**‍**A schema defines the shape, order, and type of data stored in [ML artifacts](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/ml-artifacts), including:  [[Feature Groups|feature groups]], [[Feature View|feature views]], training datasets, and models. The schema enables the validation of the shape, order, and type of data that is either read from or input to a ML artifact. Some ML artifacts, such as feature groups, feature views, and models can support schema versioning. A schema version change indicates that the new version has a breaking schema change compared to the previous version.

**Why is a schema important for ML artifacts?**
-----------------------------------------------

1. **Enforcing data contracts:** A schema defines the structure and data types of features within a feature group, ensuring that the data conforms to a specific format. This enforces a [data contract](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/data-contract) between producers and consumers of the features, which is crucial for maintaining consistency and reliability in the [machine learning pipeline](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/ml-pipeline).
2. **Promoting best practices:** By defining a schema, data engineers and data scientists are encouraged to follow best practices in data modeling and management.
3. [**Versioning**](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/versioning-ml-artifacts)**:** Schemas enable versioning of feature groups. If the structure or data types of a feature group change, a new schema version can be created to accommodate the changes without disrupting existing pipelines or models.
4. **Error detection:** With a schema in place, errors in data shape, order, or type can be detected early in the pipeline, making it easier to identify and fix issues before they propagate downstream.
