**What is model-centric ML?**
-----------------------------

**‚Äç**Model-centric ML is an approach to machine learning that focuses on iteratively improving model architecture and [hyperparameters](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/hyperparameter) to enhance [model performance](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-performance). This method emphasizes the importance of finding the best model architecture, configuration, and hyperparameters to achieve the desired level of accuracy and generalization for a given task.  


**When should you consider model-centric ML?**
----------------------------------------------

You need to consider model-centric ML when the primary goal of your machine learning project is to optimize and improve the [model architecture](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/model-architecture) and performance of your models for a static training dataset. This approach is particularly relevant when dealing with complex problems, where the choice of architecture and hyperparameters can have a significant impact on the model's accuracy and efficiency.
