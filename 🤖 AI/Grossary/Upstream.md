**What is an upstream user/client/application?**
------------------------------------------------

Upstream indicates that the user/client/application is a producer of data to a given dataset or [feature group](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-groups) (that itself is downstream). Upstream users/clients/applications should respect the [data contract](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/data-contract) of the dataset or feature group that they are updating.
