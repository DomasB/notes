**What is a train set?**
------------------------

**‚Äç**The train (or training) set is the portion of the [[Training Data|training data]] that is used to train a machine learning model. It typically consists of 70-85% of the total available training data. It is essential to ensure that the training set is representative of the problem domain and includes a diverse set of examples. To maintain the integrity of the training process and avoid overfitting, it is essential to keep the training set separate from the [validation](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/validation-set) and [test sets](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/test-set). These other sets are used to fine-tune the model's [hyperparameters](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/hyperparameter) and evaluate its performance on unseen data, respectively.
