**What is a python UDF in SQL?**
--------------------------------

A SQL UDF (User-Defined Function) is a custom function that extends the capabilities of SQL by allowing users to implement complex logic and [transformations](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/transformation) that are not available with built-in SQL functions. This is important for [feature engineering](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-engineering) and model inference, as custom [feature functions](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-function) or [inference pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/inference-pipeline) can be written in a language like Python and can then be invoked from within a SQL query.
