**What is a feature service?**
------------------------------

**‚Äç**A feature service is a [feature view](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-view) that is implemented as a network service that provides both an online and offline API for retrieving [feature vectors](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-vector) and batches of [feature values](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-value), respectively. Some feature services require users to provide labels and their timestamps when retrieving features for [training data](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/training-data).
