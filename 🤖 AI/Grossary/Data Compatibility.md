**What is data compatibility in ML?**
-------------------------------------

[Features](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature) are the main data inputs for models for training and inference. Data compatibility often refers to feature consistency, where the schema of features used in [feature pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-pipeline), [training pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/training-pipeline), and [inference pipelines](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/inference-pipeline) is compatible - enabling feature pipelines to create features that can then be used without data type errors in training and inference.
