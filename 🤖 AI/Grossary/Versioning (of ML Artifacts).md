**What is versioning of ML artifacts and why is it important for MLOps?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**‚Äç**Versioning of models, [features](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature), [feature groups](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-groups), [feature views](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-view), and [training datasets](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/train-training-set) enables the management of dependencies between ML artifacts. For example, in the figure below, we can see that when the *fraud* mode upgraded from version 1 to version 2, the [precomputed features](http://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/precomputed-features) used by *fraud\_v2* have changed to *transactions\_v2*. This means when you deploy the new model, you need to connect it to the correct new versions of the feature in the online [feature store](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-store). If there is a problem with *fraud\_v2* and you rollback to *fraud\_v1*, you need to connect *fraud\_v1* to *transactions\_v1*, so the [feature pipeline](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/feature-pipeline) feeding *transactions\_v1* should not be turned off until you are sure you will never have to downgrade from *fraud\_v2*. Here, we can see that versioning enables smooth upgrading and downgrading of model versions and their dependent features.
