LLMOps is MLOps for Large Language Models and it is a set of practices for the operationalization of applications that use LLMs to provide intelligent language-based services.

This involves the management of 

* fine-tuning LLMs
* prompt engineering
* retrievers for external data sources: vector databases and/or feature stores
* infrastructure for training, deploying, and serving LLMs

LLMOps defines best practices for how to operationalize LLMs and the data infrastructure needed for prompt engineering, integrating external data, model fine-tuning, and model deployment. 

LLMOps allows for the efficient deployment, monitoring and maintenance of large language models. LLMOps, like traditional Machine Learning Ops (MLOps), requires a collaboration of data scientists, DevOps engineers and IT professionals.
